Handheld RFID Reader
This repository contains the complete design files, firmware, software, and documentation for a Handheld High-Frequency (HF) RFID Reader. This project was developed as a partial fulfillment of the requirements for the module EN 2161: Electronic Design Realization at the Department of Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa.

The device is designed for mobile workflows, enabling fast and reliable identification of 13.56 MHz RFID tags, with data synchronized to a central database via Wi-Fi.

‚ú® Features
Ergonomic Design: A comfortable, gun-shaped enclosure with an ergonomic handle, designed in SolidWorks and 3D printed for industry-level durability.

HF RFID Capability: Reads HF (13.56 MHz) RFID tags, supporting the ISO 15693 standard.

Wireless Connectivity: Integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi module for direct communication with a cloud database, offering greater range and flexibility compared to Bluetooth.

Modular PCB Design: Three separate 2-layer PCBs for the Antenna, MCU, and Power circuits to ensure signal integrity and simplify debugging.

Rechargeable Power System: Powered by two 18650 Li-Ion batteries (total capacity ~3600 mAh), with a dedicated charging cradle and a Battery Management System (BMS) for safety and longevity.

User Interface:

LED indicators for power, Wi-Fi status, and read confirmation.

A comprehensive Web Application (Node.js) for system management, data visualization, and device configuration.

A cross-platform Mobile Application (Flutter) for on-the-go data access and monitoring.

Centralized Database: Utilizes Supabase (PostgreSQL) for robust, scalable, and secure data storage with row-level security policies.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The system is designed around a central microcontroller (ATmega32U4) that interfaces with the RFID frontend (PN5180) and the Wi-Fi module (ESP8266). Data is sent to a cloud database and can be accessed via web and mobile applications.

üíª Software & Firmware
Firmware
ATmega32U4: Programmed in C++ using Atmel Studio. It handles SPI communication with the PN5180 and UART communication with the ESP8266.

ESP8266: Programmed using the ESP8266 RTOS SDK. It receives data from the ATmega32U4 via UART and transmits it to the Supabase backend over Wi-Fi.

Database
The backend uses Supabase, which provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time APIs. The schema is designed to store information about users, readers, tags, and scan events.

Web & Mobile Applications
A web app (Node.js) and a mobile app (Flutter) provide a user-friendly interface to manage the RFID system.
